# For Upstream Only

This file tree is intended for upstreaming into Nixpkgs and nix-darwin.
Do not import these files directly!
To use a specific version of the agent, you should use the Nix expressions such
as `module.nix` at the project root.

# Do not import from this directory!

These individual files are not considered to be part of the agent's public
interface and will change in unexpected ways.
