## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2019-08-30

### Added

- Support for import-from-derivation. See https://blog.hercules-ci.com/2019/08/30/native-support-for-import-for-derivation/ for details.

### Changed


- Report build failures and technical errors (misconfigurations, etc) separately

- Remove HerculesScribe

- Worker now uses structured logging (including worker pid, etc)

### Fixed

- Disable parallel GHC GC to improve runtime performance

- Bump Cachix to fix a few bugs (errors with too many derivations, performance fixes, etc.)

 - Modern BoehmGC initial settings for Nix memory limits 

## [0.3.2] - 2019-08-11

### Fixed

- Deploying the agent from different system (darwin to linux) resulted into
  using the wrong executable


## [0.3.1] - 2019-08-07

### Changed

- Emit a log when evaluator starts to push to cachix

- Increase attribute limit to 50k

- Pin nixpkgs commit and speed up compilation via https://hercules-ci.cachix.org


### Fixed

- Possible exception during evaluation was not propagated,
  resulting into lack of retries

- #8: Refresh agent session on cluster join token change

- Fix segfault on involved IFD project (remove a finalizer)

- Cachix: fix a crash with a lot of attributes (when determining closure graph)

## [0.3.0] - 2019-07-05

### Changed

- Configuration of the agent is now done via `--config agent.toml`
  so all command line arguments were removed.

  See https://docs.hercules-ci.com/#agent-configuration-file

- NixOS-based deployments now require `enable`.

      services.hercules-ci-agent.enable = true;

- All files are placed/expected in new locations that by default derive
  from the `baseDirectory` option in the `agent.toml` file.

  You may remove `~/.hercules-ci-agent` and `~/.local/share/hercules-ci-agent` after upgrading.

### Fixed

- Added retries to status reporting to fix potential
  inconsistencies on the service

### Added

- Added Cachix support, for multi-agent and multi-platform support

- Report derivation outputs with their size and hashes

- Added Darwin support via nix-darwin

- Support `requiredFeatures` attribute on derivations

- Hello and hearthbeat protocol, which will allow the
  service to be aware of how the agent is configured and
  when it's online.

## [0.2] - 2019-05-14

- use [gitignore] instead of [nix-gitignore]
- fix build on Darwin
- limit internal concurrency to max eight OS threads for beefier machines
- show version on `--help`
- build against NixOS 19.03 as default
- propagate agent information to agent view: Nix version, substituters,
  platform and Nix features
